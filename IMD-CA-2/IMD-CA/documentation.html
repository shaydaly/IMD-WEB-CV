    <ul>
        <li>I used a template to base the CSS of the skeleton of the project for the project on, all of bootstrap features present in the project
        I created myself</li>
        <li>This template is located at <a href="http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/website-templates/orbit-free-resume-cv-template-for-developers/" target="_blank">3rdwavemedia.com</a></li>

<h1>Dynamic Content</h1>
    <ul><li>For the dynamic aspects of the project  I used AngularJS.</li>
    <li>First to read my previous
        exam results in from a json file this involved the use of the  ng-app & ng-repeat.
    This allowed the results to be added dynamically, as opposed to having to manually
    add each on to the html file.</li>
        <li>This method was also used for the dynamic retrieval of my skills and proficiency in each</li>
        <li>I also used angular to get the current date and time to display in the footer of each page. This is loaded
    dynamically every time a user comes to the page</li>
    </ul>

<div class="container-fluid" id="InteractiveElement">
<h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There was a mixture of CSS and JQuery involved</li>
        <li> Modals were used to enlarge the profile picture, along with my third year project image</li>
        <li>Modals were also used for the Contact form. The contact form uses 'JotForm' and sends an email to my account when
        a user enters the form.</li>
        <li>A carousel was also used in the second year project to scroll through the different images</li>
        <li>JS Tab (tab.js) was used to change the pages. This allowed the user to pick their page from the nav bar and
        only that page would be displayed to the user</li>
    </ul>
